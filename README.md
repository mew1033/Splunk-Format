Automatically format splunk searches

## Installation
Install via [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)

Or I guess you can copy the .sublime-package file to the correct directory. But why would you do that?

## Usage
There are two ways to use this.
1. Ctrl + Shift + p - Splunk Format: Format page = This will format the entire document you're looking at.
2. Ctrl + Shift + p - Splunk Format: Format selection = This will format the currently selected text.

## Disclaimer
I hacked this together in a few hours. It's almost definitely broken in some way or another. If it breaks, sorry about that. I accept pull requests.

## Credits
I got the idea from http://www.bbosearch.com/pretty I have no idea who runs that site. If you find out, let me know.
